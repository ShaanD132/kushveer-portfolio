# Jordan Lau's Portfolio Website
This was a pretty fun project, I learnt quite a bit about Chakra UI, making things responsive (easily!) and framer-motion.

## Use

It was a website for commercial use so I did put a __lot of effort__ into the design. Currently, it is not fully developed.

You can access the website through this link: https://jordan-lau.vercel.app
