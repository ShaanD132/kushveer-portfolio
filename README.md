# Kushveer Ramessur's Portfolio Website
A project for a friend needed for a design course. Not very difficult as I had already learnt how to use Next JS and Chakra-UI.

## Use

It was a website for commercial use so I did put a __lot of effort__ into the design. Currently, it is not fully developed.

You can access the website through this link: https://kush-r.vercel.app

## Libraries Used
- Framer-Motion
- Chakra UI
- Next JS
- Emotion
- React
